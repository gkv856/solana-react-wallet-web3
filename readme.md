# Welcome from GKV's repository

## This repo is a boilerplate project that handles following things.

1. How to connect to Solana wallet using different providers like Phantom
2. Once connected to a wallet, it keeps the state of wallet persistent accross different pages of the app.
3. It implements Redux to maintain the store (technically authentication) and gives an universal "Layout" to the app to start with.
